								<p>On January 20th, they both got ready for a night at the club. She came with friends and he was rolling solo. She was out to have fun and he was out to meet new people in a new city. She saw him first. He returned her smile. They found each other on the dance floor. They introduced themselves. He heard Star. She heard Hicks. They danced and danced and danced. They got to know each other over burgers and fries. He learned her name was Char. She learned he called himself Hitch. (Scroll right to read what happens next &rarr;)</p>

								<p>On January 27th 2012, they had their first date. The Chicago snow fell heavy making his walk to the restaurant a mile trek in knee high snow. She slowed her drive to a mere 10 miles an hour. The restaurant nearly canceled their reservation. As they traveled, they both wondered if the other was as attractive as they remembered. He waited patiently to see the smile that caught his eye the week before. She walked in to see him as handsome as the night they met. Even the waitress cheered “You made it!” at her arrival. They talked of their families, hobbies and more over Cuban food. Not wanting the night to end they went to get drinks at a nearby bar to continue the conversation.

								<p>In the 4 years that followed, the two grew closer. They shared laughter and loss. They encouraged and supported one another. They met each other’s family and friends. They created inside jokes and learned each other’s pet peeves. They matured as people, they matured as partners. They worked continuously on their commitment to one another.(Scroll right for the big surprise &rarr;)</p>

								<p>On May 27th 2016, they went to see their very first Beyoncé concert. He had in his pocket the ring he’d held onto for quite some time waiting for the perfect moment. She was excited to share one of her favorite artists with her favorite person in life. He asked her what songs she hoped to hear. She made sure they took photos to remember the major musical event. Much like their very first date the imperfect Chicago weather greeted them. Prepared for the downpour and strong winds they laughed as others ran for cover and waited for the main event. Beyoncé did what she does best while they sang and danced along with the crowd. The two held each other close as Beyoncé slowly sang “Love On Top” a cappella, the crowd joining in the ballad. Hitch slipped the ring onto Char’s hand and gently squeezed. “Will you?” he asked. She smiled and kissed him. Words were not necessary.</p>
